Channel Statistics Aggregation Bot

## To Do List

* Refactor ignore list to use an IgnoreList object
* Purge data for nick
* Alias list (for merging stats for different nicks e.g. nj and netjester)
* Some way of identifying the admin?
    * Command channel?
* Database migrations?
* Refactor stats monitoring into a behaviour/module, and add a behaviour/module for fun stuff like !stick etc
* Don't say you're doing something redundant with the ignore lists - check list and respond appropriately
